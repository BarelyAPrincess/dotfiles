# Development setup for a Windows box
> For WSL2 setups

I basically do not have much to setup for pure Windows development anymore.
There used to be a lot of Cygwin and Scoop stuff here, but since 2016 I do
most of my development in a Linux VM or WSL2.

Therefore, Windows stuff is mostly about linking the Windows
world to the Linux world:
- re-using Git Credential Manager for Windows in WSL2
- re-using the 1Password SSH Agent in WSL2
